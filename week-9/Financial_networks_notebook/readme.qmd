# Lab sheet for the Financial networks lab


## Getting Stearted

Please download the notebooks associated with this lab from the usual class repository.

for this lab a companion 'data' folder, local to the notebook, is required.

Alternatively, change the file paths in the notebook accordingly.

## Data

Have a go at installing `yfinance,` a Python package that gets financial data from Yahoo's APIs.

For those running Anaconda the command should be

```bash
C:\WINDOWS\system32>conda install -c ranaroussi yfinance
```

unfortunately, this may generate installation errors on some platforms, e.g., Win 10 LTS at Birkbeck.

## Data, cont'd 

To make the notebook more dynamic, we use `Yahoofinancials`:

[github.com/JECSand/yahoofinancials](https://github.com/JECSand/yahoofinancials)

The module may also be available from Anaconda.
