        "This formula's advantage is that it can computed in linear time, $O(n)$. The drawback, however, is that it does not handle feature interactions. To capture interactions, we could introduce a weight for each feature combination. This is sometimes referred to as a $2_{nd}$ ordered polynomial. The resulting model is shown below:\n",

Every feature $f_i$ has a corresponding latent factor $v_i$, and two features' interactions are modelled as $\\langle \\textbf{v}_i, \\textbf{v}_{j} \\rangle$, where $\\langle \\cdot \\;,\\cdot \\rangle$ refers to the dot product of the two feature vector.
