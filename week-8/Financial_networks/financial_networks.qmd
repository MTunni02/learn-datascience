# Financial Networks

## Introduction

Theme: discover a relationship among traded shares (equity)

. . .

look at historical market data to see whether price variations relate to each other.

Are there *regularities* that could anticipate the future behaviour of price?

. . .

In Food Networks (Ch. 1) we discovered a regularity:

$\frac{\# pred}{\# prey} \approx 1$

## Important assumption

When markets are *calm,* investment becomes somewhat `mathematical'

<!-- ----------- -->
# Price time series

## Proportional return on investment

- depends on time

- essentially, the discrete counterpart of the time derivative of price:

$$
r(\Delta t) = \frac{p(t_0 + \Delta t) - p(t_0)}{p(t_0)}
$$

-----

$$
r(\Delta t) = \frac{p(t_0 + \Delta t) - p(t_0)}{p(t_0)}
$$


as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$ returns tend to 0

We can apply the well-known Taylor expansion:

$$
\ln{(1+x)} = x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 -\frac{1}{3}x^3 + \dots
$$

take only the first element of the expansion, $x$, and substitute:

$$
\ln{(1 + r(\Delta t))} \approx r(\Delta t) 
$$

-----


$$
r(\Delta t) \approx  \ln{(1+\frac{p(t_0 + \Delta t) - p(t_0)}{p(t_0)})}
$$

$$
r(\Delta t) \approx \ln{\frac{p(t_0) + p(t_0 + \Delta t) - p(t_0)}{p(t_0)}}
$$

$$
= \ln{\frac{p(t_0 + \Delta t)}{p(t_0)}} = \ln{p(t_0 + \Delta t)} - \ln{p(t_0)}
$$

-----

in conclusion,

$$
r(\Delta t) \approx \ln p(t_0 + \Delta t) - \ln p(t_0)
$$


Also, Quant Finance considers the *instantaneous* returns function as the derivative of the logged prices:

$$
r(t) \simeq  \frac{d \ln{p(t)}}{dt}
$$

-----

## Correlation of returns

- correlations in time series (or simply *comovements*) are valuable indicators

- Two shares are correlated if historically they *moved in a similar way.*

- To qualify such a relation compute the correlation between their price returns over $\Delta t$.

. . .

Let $\langle r_i \rangle$ be the average return of *i* over $\Delta t$

-----

$$
\rho_{ij}(\Delta t) = \frac{\langle r_i r_j\rangle - \langle r_i\rangle \langle r_j\rangle}{\sqrt{(\langle r_i^2\rangle - \langle r_i\rangle^2 )( \langle r_j^2\rangle - \langle r_j\rangle^2)}}
$$

- high $\rho$'s might uncover hidden links between stocks.

- however, monitoring $n(n-1)$ correlations quickly becomes unfeseable
  
- we focus on high $\rho$ values.

<!-- -------------------------------- -->
# The Spanning tree of stocks

## Similar-behaviour shares

Correlation (or lack of it) induces a *distance* b/w shares:

$$
d_{ij}(\Delta t) = \sqrt{2(1-\rho_{ij}(\Delta t))}
$$

Let $D(\Delta t)$ be the complete matrix of pairwise distances:

it describes a complete, weighted network!

. . .

*Prune* it to create its Mimimum Spanning Tree (MST)

The MST has only n-1 *heavy* connections while maintaining connectivity.

## Resulting model

The MST of 141 NYSE high-cap stocks, $\Delta t =$ 6h:30min

![](./imgs/stock-spanning-tree.png)

Some shares are *hubs* for local clusters of highly-correlated shares.

## Consequences

- Network analysis helps indentifying local clusters

- Each clusters will have a *hub share* at its center

- Hub shares can *signal* the beaviour of the whole cluster:

- they provide leads in forecasting how sections of the market will move.
